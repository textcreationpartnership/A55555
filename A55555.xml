            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>There was civill diſſention betweene the heards-men of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and certainely it was about their ſubſtance.

                     <p>It was the crying ſcarlet ſinne of <hi>Caine</hi> in the firſt infancy of the world, and hath beene, and is ſo horrid and deteſtable, as that by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of 2 <hi>Edward</hi> 3, 2, and 14 <hi>Edward</hi> 3, 15, a Charter of pardon was not to be allowed in ſuch a caſe.</p>
                     <p>By the Statute of 13 <hi>Richard</hi> 2, Stat. 2 c. 1, It

                     <p>Hence it was that a charter of pardon of all felonies will not diſcharge a <hi>Murther,</hi> without expreſſe words.</p>

                  <p>There are two ſorts of Legall Oaths uſed and practiſed within this Realme <hi>(viz.) Iuramentum conſuctudinarium,</hi> warranted by the cuſtome of the Realm, which is no more than the Common Law. 2 <hi>Iuramentum Parliamentarium,</hi> an Oath created and enacted by all the three States, as the Oath of Supremacie preſcribed 1 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1.

                  <p>And no Oath can be impoſed upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject but what is enabled by the uſage of the Common Law, or by an Act of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>This ancient Oath was in time very long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great Charter, as in the former tract is remonſtrated. And bath beene confirmed from time to time, in and by <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> So that it hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And I will neither know, nor heare of any ill or dammage intended unto him, that I will not defend. So help me God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Oath containes a reall proteſtation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Subjects dutie to his Soveraigne, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declares what <hi>Subjection</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> ought to be expected from them, and implicitely the office of the King towards his people, which is <hi>protection,</hi> for it is truly ſaid, That <hi>protectio tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hit ſubjectionem, &amp; ſubjectio protectionem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is cleare that the generall obligation of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and duties from the people, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and prerogatives royall in the Prince are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the law of God, and are part of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:108882:86"/>Law of Nature, whereto all Nations have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, which if I ſhould Illuſtrate (as well I might) by innumerable teſtimonies, preſidents and examples, aſwell out of ſacred Scriptures and Fathers, as out of Heathen Writers, Hiſtorians and others, it would fill up a larger volumne, than this Subject would require.</p>
                  <p>I am onely to deale with that ſubjective faith and Legeance, which by the provinciall Lawes of this land, which are <hi>(Generalis conſuetudo Regni Anglicae.)</hi> is naturally, and legally <hi>jure haeredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> due to the perſon and royaltie of his ſacred Majeſtie.</p>
                  <p>This Legeance is derived to him from <hi>Lex ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terna,</hi> the Morall Law, called alſo the Law of nature, part whereof the Law of England is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt written <hi>in Tabulis rectae rationis,</hi> in the heart of man; and the people by that Law go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned two thouſand yeares, before it was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and before any judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or municipall lawes.</p>

Maſter <hi>Skency, De verborum ſignificatione, verbo ligeantia,</hi> ſaith, That it is derived from the Italian word <hi>(liga) viz.</hi> a bond, league, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.</p>
                  <p>As a great Lord Chancellor in the caſe of <hi>poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati</hi> ſaid, That <hi>ligeantia</hi> underſtood <hi>ſenſu currenti</hi> in the language of the time, is <hi>vincuſum fidei &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedientiae,</hi> the tye or bond of faith and obedience. And he that is borne in any of the Kings domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and under the Kings obedience is the Kings leige Subject, and borne <hi>ad fidem Regis,</hi> That is (being the proper word uſed in the Law of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) to be faithfull to the King.</p>
                  <p>It extendeth further in all caſes of denization, which is called <hi>ligeantia acquiſita,</hi> where any ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en or ſtranger borne out of the Kings Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doth afterwards by any common grant of the King, any Act of Parliament, or other waies or meanes, obtaine the freedome of a Subject with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Land.</p>

                     </hi> and the reaſon is plaine, For if to ſuch a perſon any injury is done, either in life, member, or eſtate, the Law taketh as ſevere an accompt, and inflicteth as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a puniſhment upon the offenders in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as if the partie injured had beene <hi>ſubditus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> borne within his Majeſties dominions.</p>
                  <p>Then great reaſon, that ſuch perſons having the benefit of naturall borne ſubjects (which is <hi>protection</hi> from ſuffering any detriment or harme) ſhould bee as free from acting and doing any wrong, for as they have <hi>idem beneficium,</hi> they muſt have <hi>idem ſupplicium,</hi> as the ſame protection in good actions, ſo the ſame correction in bad. It was <hi>Sherley</hi> the Frenchmans caſe, who being in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and under the protection of King <hi>Philip</hi> and Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> joyned and conſpired with d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>We have ſeene what Legeance is,<note place="margin">2. Branch.</note> let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the extent of it, in its explication by this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Oath, which I may well terme <hi>vinculum vinculi,</hi> or <hi>ligamentum ligaminis.</hi> That <hi>Legeanee,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:108882:88"/>Faith</hi> or <hi>Fealtie,</hi> which is annexed by birthright, is by this Oath ſolemnly explained, atteſted and confirmed, and is called <hi>legalis ligeantia,</hi> eſtabliſhed by the wiſedome of ancient times, and had its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining with the nationall laws of this Iſland in the time of the <hi>Brittons.</hi> It is true that this oath doth not create the Legeance of a ſubject, but doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the fruits of faith and obedience, which muſt ever bee concomitant with ſubjection: For as it was gravely obſerved in the booke of <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati, fo.</hi> 64. <hi>Subjectio, fides et obedientia,</hi> muſt be in a true and lawfull ſubject, of what Nation ſoever, and cannot be ſevered, no more than true faith and charitie in a true Chriſtian. And hee that hath theſe three from his nativitie is <hi>ligeus Regis,</hi> the Kings Leige man. Hence I inferre, that <hi>ligeantia</hi> is <hi>viſibilis</hi> and <hi>inviſibilis,</hi> viſible as to ſubjection and obedience, and inviſible as to fidelitie and loyaltie, this muſt bee rooted in the heart, the other expreſſed in the action.

In this Iſland of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> this oath of Legeance was firſt invented by King <hi>Arthur,</hi> At which time the Leet was called <hi>Folke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote (viz.)</hi> a meeting of the people, and this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation is retained in <hi>London</hi> to this day.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the Lawes of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, before the Conqueſt, it is thus expreſt, <hi>Omnes Principes &amp; Comites, Proceres, Milites &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beri homines debent jurare, &amp;c. in Folkemote, &amp; &amp; fimiliter ownes Proceres Regni, Milites, &amp; liberi homines univerſi totius Regni Britanniae facere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent in pleno Folkemote fidelitatem Domino Regi, &amp;c.

                  <p>This later is inlarged in the occaſionall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, but the generall ſcope thereof is tacitly and implicitly compriſed, in that other ancient and well digeſted oath, this maine difference
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:108882:89"/>ſtands between them, the former oath is confined as toperſons, time, and place; the later hath its extention to all perſons, without any exception.</p>
                  <p>There is the like oath uſed in the civill or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall law, called <hi>juramentum ligei,</hi> one of the old, another of a new invention, cited <hi>Lib</hi> 3. <hi>Summae Hoſtienſis, fo.</hi> 773. and thus begins. <hi>Ego T. juro ſuper ſancta Dei Evangelia, quod ab hac hora ero fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis contra omnem hominem, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The Civilians diſtinguiſh two ſorts of oaths, <hi>Iudiciall,</hi> and <hi>Extrajudiciall.</hi> And their oath of <hi>juramentum ligei vel fidelitatis,</hi> they ranke in the number of extrajudiciall oathes.
